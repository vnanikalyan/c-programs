/*
d. Write a C program that does the following:
It should first create a binary file and store 10 integers, where the file name and 10
values are given in the command line. (hint: convert the strings using atoi function)
Now the program asks for an index and a value from the user and the value at that
index should be changed to the new value in the file. (hint: use fseek function)
The program should then read all 10 values and print them back.
